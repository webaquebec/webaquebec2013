            <div class="overview">
                                    <p>Everyday technology is hurtling into the realm of science fiction, even magic, with new devices that are as surprising and delightful as they are useful. Developers and designers are running hard to keep up with this warp-speed pace of tech innovation, and for now, mobile devices are at the forefront. But what's next? Trends are emerging at the hazy edges of the tech universe that hint at the future of computer interfaces, including computers without interfaces at all.</p>

<p>Designer Josh Clark, author of "Tapworthy," takes you on an expedition of this final frontier. Learn how smartphones and other sensor-rich devices have changed how we approach computing, and explore how we can better design for sensors. Learn how dumber machines will make us smarter, and how our current work lays the groundwork for a future of social devices. Along the way, you'll see how games lead the fleet, how robots can help us build our software, and why post-PC computing is about far more than phones and tablets. Finally, understand how a smart approach to technology choices now will better prepare you for the future, to boldly go where no geek has gone before.</p>

                        <p>Josh Clark is a designer specializing in mobile design, strategy, and user experience. He's author of "Tapworthy: Designing Great iPhone Apps" (O'Reilly, 2010) and "Best iPhone Apps" (O'Reilly, 2009). Josh's agency Global Moxie offers design services, strategic consulting, and training to help creative organizations build tapworthy mobile apps and websites. Before the internet swallowed him up, Josh was a management consultant at Monitor Group in Cambridge, Mass, and before that, a producer of national PBS programs at Boston's WGBH. He shared his three words of Russian with Mikhail Gorbachev, strolled the ranch with Nancy Reagan, hobnobbed with Rockefellers, and wrote trivia questions for a primetime game show. In 1996, he created the uberpopular "Couch-to-5K" (C25K) running program, which has helped millions of skeptical would-be exercisers take up jogging. (His motto is the same for fitness as it is for software user experience: no pain, no pain.)</p>
