                                    <p>The first user interfaces needed to communicate abstract and foreign concepts with easily relatable metaphors. Over the past 30 years, the visual language of user interfaces have continued to evolve from that same standpoint: that they should evoke the familiar, analog experience of tools, buttons, knobs, dials, and other tangible artefacts of the physical world. That foundation has led to a very specific visual library in interactive experiences. But in the past year, a distinct aesthetic shift has occured, which is pushing against the textures, decorations, and effects that have become so common in the interfaces we use every day.</p>

<p>Mike Kruzeniski will look at why this shift is happening, and what it means for designers working on user interfaces now. Come to learn about the history of Design in the technology space, and how recent technology trends have allowed designers to think differently about their approach to UI. Mike will share his personal experience working on the Windows Phone UI - originally called Metro - and what he's learned from watching this design trend emerge over the past few years. After this talk you'll understand the new influences that are starting to shape user interface design today, and the skills that are needed to create modern interfaces now and for the future.</p>
